# GeometricMatrixAlgebras

This package is a playground for learning about Geometric Algebra (GA), and intends to leverage Julia's powerful 
Linear Algebra ecosystem to compute quantities in GA using matrices as a backend.

This package is currently unregistered. To add it to a julia environment, do
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/MasonProtter/GeometricMatrixAlgebras.jl")
```
